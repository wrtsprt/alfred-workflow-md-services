# Alfred Workflow to trigger (MD) services

* Alfred 3 workflow
* triggering macOS services
* currently markdown services
* maybe others make sense as well, I am not sure yet

I like the [markdown services](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/markdown-service-tools/) by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/contact/).
Trying to use markdown more they come in very handy. I do spend my time a lot in non Cocoa editors though, where triggering
macOS services is a bit more difficult. Since I am an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) fan as well, this the attempt of making
this work together.
